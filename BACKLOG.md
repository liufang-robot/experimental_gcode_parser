# BACKLOG

## How To Use
- Agent picks from top to bottom by priority.
- Each task must include acceptance criteria before work starts.
- Completed tasks are moved to a done section in this file or linked from PR.

## Priority Legend
- `P0`: must fix now (blocker, broken CI, crash/data-loss/security risk)
- `P1`: high-value near-term
- `P2`: important but can wait
- `P3`: optional/enhancement

## Ready Queue

### T-010 (P2) Message diagnostics policy and severity mapping
Why:
- Need explicit policy for parser/lowering errors at message stage.
Acceptance criteria:
- Define and implement policy (skip/partial message emission) in SPEC + code.
- Add tests that validate diagnostic severity and emission policy.

## Icebox
- Performance benchmarking harness.
- Coverage threshold policy and badge.
- Multi-file include/subprogram parsing (future SPEC).

## Task Template
Use this template for new backlog items:

- `ID`: T-XXX
- `Priority`: P0/P1/P2/P3
- `Title`:
- `Why`:
- `Scope`:
- `Acceptance Criteria`:
- `Out of Scope`:
- `SPEC Sections`:
- `Tests To Add/Update`:
