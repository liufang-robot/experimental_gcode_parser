# BACKLOG

## How To Use
- Agent picks from top to bottom by priority.
- Each task must include acceptance criteria before work starts.
- Completed tasks are moved to a done section in this file or linked from PR.

## Priority Legend
- `P0`: must fix now (blocker, broken CI, crash/data-loss/security risk)
- `P1`: high-value near-term
- `P2`: important but can wait
- `P3`: optional/enhancement

## Ready Queue
### T-017 (P2) Add long-input stress smoke test for parser/lowering
Why:
- ROADMAP M1/M4 call for stronger resilience checks under larger inputs.
Scope:
- Add a deterministic stress-smoke test for large valid input and basic
  resource-envelope assertions.
Acceptance criteria:
- Add stress test covering parse + lower on large multi-line program input.
- Assert no crash/hang and stable expected output shape for that input.
- `./dev/check.sh` passes.
Out of scope:
- Grammar/semantic behavior changes.
SPEC Sections:
- Section 7 (Testing Strategy)
Tests To Add/Update:
- `test/fuzz_smoke_tests.cpp`

## Icebox
- Performance benchmarking harness.
- Coverage threshold policy and badge.
- Multi-file include/subprogram parsing (future SPEC).

## Task Template
Use this template for new backlog items:

- `ID`: T-XXX
- `Priority`: P0/P1/P2/P3
- `Title`:
- `Why`:
- `Scope`:
- `Acceptance Criteria`:
- `Out of Scope`:
- `SPEC Sections`:
- `Tests To Add/Update`:
